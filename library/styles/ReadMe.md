Purpose of the Folder: Style

This is where "snippets", strings of code, "shortcodes", "mixins" and others can be stored that will be referenced; those that are directly used may remain in the "Styles" Directory Folder; they will need to be labeled accordingly with "style-" as the prefix and end in .CSS.
